video games sales  data analysis and modeling


Video games have become immensely popular over the past decade. The global games market in 2019 was estimated at $148.8 billion. So , companies are very interested to understand video games trends to provide users with best and latest technology  as well as to get big share of this huge market. 

This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com.

In this project , I did two tasks:
Exploratory Data Analysis(preprocessing)
Designing and building model prediction
